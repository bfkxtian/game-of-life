# Conway's Game of Life
## Written in JavaScript/Canvas

Conway's Game of Life is a simple cellular automata which relies on simple rules to generate complex results.
It formed a fun and challenging project for learning JavaScript and web graphics in general.

If you want to see a running example, head over to https://benchristian.xyz/posts/life, or alternatively create a simple webpage with a canvas element (height, width of 800px).
The main issues currently are as follows:
- Board size is hardcoded and does not support resizing.
- Performance could be much better, investigating more efficient algorithms for calculating next board state.

Source code by me, Benjamin Christian. Do with it what you wish :)
